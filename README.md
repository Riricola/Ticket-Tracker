# Ticket-Tracker

This is the Ticket Tracker, a project I made with my partner, Alma Ordaz, in Grinnell College during our CSC161 - Imperitive Problem 
Solving class. This Ticket Tracker is executed in terminal and starts with a menu. For each ticket you make, you must assign it a 
technician before marking the ticket as complete. To keep track of the tickets, they are seperated to three lists, new tickets,
assigned tickets, and completed tickets. In the menu, you can choose to create a new ticket, assign a ticket to a technician, mark a 
ticket complete, or print either the list of new, assigned, or completed tickets.
